Components
This code represents a React.js web application that retrieves word frequency data from a text file hosted on https://www.terriblytinytales.com and displays the top 20 most frequently occurring words in a bar chart using the Recharts library. The application also allows the user to export the data to a CSV file.

The application consists of three main components:

App: This is the main component that renders the navbar, content container, and footer. It also contains the state for wordCounts and loading, as well as functions for handling form submission, exporting the data, and resetting the state.

BarChart: This is a Recharts component that renders the histogram chart based on the data passed to it.

Cell: This is a Recharts component that defines the color for each bar in the histogram chart.
